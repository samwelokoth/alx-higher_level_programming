## Introduction

In Python, lists and tuples are versatile data structures used for storing ordered collections of items. Lists are mutable, allowing for dynamic modifications, while tuples are immutable and provide a fixed structure.

This repository aims to provide code examples and projects to help you understand and leverage the power of lists and tuples in Python programming.

## List Examples

Explore the `list-examples` directory for code snippets demonstrating operations on lists, including:

- Creating and initializing lists
- Accessing and modifying elements
- List comprehension
- Sorting and filtering lists
- Nesting and combining lists

## Tuple Examples

Navigate to the `tuple-examples` directory to find examples showcasing the characteristics of tuples, such as:

- Creating and initializing tuples
- Accessing tuple elements
- Immutability and its advantages
- Tuple packing and unpacking
- Use cases for tuples in Python

## Projects

The `projects` directory contains more comprehensive projects that involve the practical application of lists and tuples in Python. Each project folder includes a README with specific instructions on how to run and use the project.
