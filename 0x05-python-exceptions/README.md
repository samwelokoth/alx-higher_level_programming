Python exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error or exceptional condition occurs, an exception is raised, and the normal program flow is interrupted to handle the exceptional situation.

Here are some key concepts related to Python exceptions:

    Exception Types:
        Python has a variety of built-in exception types, such as TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, and more.
        You can also create custom exceptions by defining new classes that inherit from the built-in Exception class.

    Try-Except Block:
        To handle exceptions, you use a try block to enclose the code that might raise an exception.
        The except block contains the code that is executed if a specified exception occurs in the try block.

    Exception Handling:
        You can use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
        An else block can be used to execute code if no exceptions are raised.
        The finally block, if present, is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.

    Raising Exceptions:
        You can raise exceptions explicitly using the raise statement. This is useful when you want to indicate that a certain condition has occurred.

    Exception Hierarchy:
        Exceptions form a hierarchy in Python, with the base class being BaseException. All built-in exceptions inherit from this class.

    Handling Multiple Exceptions:
        You can handle multiple exceptions in a single except block by providing a tuple of exception types.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of a try-except block:

python

try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
    print("Result:", result)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)
else:
    print("No exceptions occurred.")
finally:
    print("This block is always executed.")
