In this project, I gained knowledge about the concept of object-relational mapping (ORM) and its application in database scripting. I acquired proficiency in utilizing libraries such as MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to interact with MySQL databases effectively.

## Test Cases âœ…

* [tests](./tests): This directory contains SQL and Python scripts designed to set up test tables for all project files, generously provided by ALX.
