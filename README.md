## Introduction

High-level programming languages are designed to be easily readable and writable by humans. They abstract away the complexities of the underlying hardware and provide features that make programming more efficient and less error-prone.

## Languages

This repository covers a variety of high-level programming languages, including but not limited to:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- Ruby
- C#
- Swift
- PHP
